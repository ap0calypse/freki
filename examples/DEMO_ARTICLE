START_TEXT
***This is bold text***
///This is italic text///
___This is underlined text___

As you can see, line breaks are automatically inserted.

If you want to include links, you can do it like link::"http://somewhere.else"::"this."

It is also possible to include external pictures, like this:

img::"http://somewhere.else/pic.png"::"alternate text"

If you want to include code, you can do it like this:

CODE_START
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello world\n");
    return 0;
}
CODE_END

Pretty nifty huh?
END_TEXT
